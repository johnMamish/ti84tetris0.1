Tetris game for the ti-84 calculator in assembler!

This program is still in pre-alpha stage.  Deploying the .8xp files to an 
actual calculator may result in permanent crashing (but probably not).

This assembly code does not "play nice" with assemblers other than the Brass 
z80 assembler.  Unfortunately, Brass cannot be run natively under linux, but
the mono .NET compatibility layer does a good job of getting Brass to run.

A binary can be generated by running
    mono Brass.exe ./tetris.z80 ./tetris.bin

You also need to make sure to put a copy of the ti83plus.inc file in the source
folder.  This file can easily be found with google.

After generating the binary, it must be processed by BinPac8x in order to sign
the binary so it can be deployed on calculators [citation needed].  This step 
can be completed by executing
    python binpac8x.py ./tetris.bin

I used BinPac8x version 1.2 and Python version 2.7.3.  BinPac8x can be found 
online at <XXXTODOXXX>.

On linux, I used the TilEm emulator to develop this software

On windows, I used wabbitemu
